III. Environmental Factors
A. Family Background and Upbringing
Rizal’s family provided the foundation for his character. His mother, 

Doña Teodora, served as his first teacher, nurturing his foundational reading and writing skills. Growing up in an affluent 

Illustrado family in Calamba instilled in him early values of love, affection, and loyalty. His father, Francisco Mercado, and mother were tenants on a vast Dominican-owned estate, giving the family direct experience with the oppressive practices and financial hardships inflicted by the friar orders.

B. Educational Experiences
Rizal consistently stressed that 

proper education should always be prioritized for individual and national success. He achieved academic excellence throughout his schooling, graduating from Ateneo Municipal with a Bachelor of Arts degree and highest honors. In Manila, he began using the surname "Rizal" to avoid the suspicion of Spanish authorities. He later earned multiple degrees at the Universidad Central de Madrid, including Licentiates in Medicine and Philosophy and Letters, the latter with an 

Excellent (Sobrasaliente) rating that entitled him to a university professorship.

C. Social and Political Context of the Philippines
The defining political event of Rizal's youth was the 

martyrdom of the three Filipino priests, Gomburza, in 1872, an event that fueled his early nationalist sentiments. This social and political context, combined with his family’s experience in the 

Calamba Agrarian Unrest—where tenants faced arbitrary rent increases, high interest rates, and expulsions by the Dominican Order—solidified his resolve to use his education to critique the colonial system.
