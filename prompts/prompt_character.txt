IV. Character Analysis
A. Rizal’s Virtues and strengths
Rizal’s character was defined by a rare combination of exceptional intellectual discipline, profound empathy, and unwavering moral courage. His virtues were rooted in:

Intellectual Excellence: Demonstrated by his Sobresaliente academic ratings, his mastery of numerous languages, and his ability to contribute to multiple fields like ophthalmology, anthropology, and literature, he embodied the Illustrado ideal of educated service.

Empathy and Patriotism: His core motivation for travel, study, and writing was to alleviate the suffering of his countrymen, a drive solidified by witnessing the Calamba land disputes and the martyrdom of Gomburza.

Integrity and Resolve: His firm refusal to retract his anti-clerical views in Dapitan, despite being offered his freedom, stands as the ultimate proof of his moral integrity and commitment to his beliefs, even in the face of death.

B. Rizal’s Evolution of character over time
Rizal’s character arc was an evolution from a cautious, Europe-based reformist to a stoic, self-sacrificing martyr who understood the value of his own death. Initially, his goal was assimilation and reform, seeking to secure Filipino rights within the Spanish system through education and non-violent political means. However, his life experiences—the suppression of his novels, the persecution of his family, and his exile—forced him to recognize that change could only be catalyzed by a dramatic, undeniable sacrifice. By the time of his trial, his character had transitioned to a higher state of heroism: he no longer fought merely for reform but for national honor, accepting his condemnation as a necessary final act to awaken the Filipino people, confirming his own prophecy that he would become "a martyr more."
