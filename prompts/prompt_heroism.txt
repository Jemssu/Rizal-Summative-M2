V. Pitfalls and Heroism
Rizal’s journey was defined by severe challenges: the condemnation and prohibition of his novel, the resulting harassment of his family during the Calamba agrarian dispute , and his subsequent arrest and exile. These pitfalls, however, became the forge for his heroism. Forced to leave the country due to the danger his presence posed, he realized he could serve his country more effectively by writing abroad. His exile transformed from a punishment into an opportunity for practical application of his ideals, establishing a school and improving Dapitan’s infrastructure. His final, fatal return was fueled by a desire to confront his accusers, an act he foresaw would either restore his rights or confirm his fate as a 

"martyr more", thereby solidifying his legacy as a hero whose sacrifice was both intentional and profound.
