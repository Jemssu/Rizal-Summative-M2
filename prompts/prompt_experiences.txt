IV. Life Experiences
A. Experiences Abroad
Rizal’s departure for Europe in 1882 was a secret mission, motivated by the need to keenly 

observe the life, culture, language, and laws of European nations in preparation for liberating his countrymen from Spanish rule. While abroad, he immersed himself in science and ophthalmology, publishing his seminal novel, 

Noli Me Tangere, in Berlin. His life in Germany was compelling, marked by a scientific atmosphere and the absence of racial prejudice, which undoubtedly contributed to his liberal worldview.

B. Life in Dapitan
After his first homecoming was met with threats from friars and led to his arrest for smuggling seditious leaflets like 

Pobres Frailes, Rizal was exiled to Dapitan in 1892. He was offered residence in the parish convent on the condition that he retract his anti-religious and anti-Spanish statements, which he refused. His four years in Dapitan were a testament to his versatility and commitment to community development, where he served simultaneously as a 

doctor, farmer, teacher, engineer, and businessman.

C. Rizal’s Arrest, Trial, and Execution
Rizal’s return trip to the Philippines in 1896, while intending to serve as a military doctor in Cuba, ended with his immediate arrest and detention in Fort Santiago. He was tried by a court-martial and convicted on the charges of 

rebellion, sedition, and conspiracy. On December 30, 1896, he was executed at Bagumbayan (Luneta). In a final act of dignity, he requested to be shot in the front because he was 

not a traitor.
