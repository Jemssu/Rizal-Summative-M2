                    The development of José Rizal's character was profoundly influenced by his surroundings, education, and the sociopolitical climate of his time. These environmental factors played crucial roles in molding him into the national hero we know today.

                <p>
                    José Rizal's character was fundamentally shaped by his family environment. His mother, Doña Teodora, served as his first teacher, nurturing his foundational reading and writing skills. Growing up in an affluent Illustrado family in Calamba instilled in him early values of love, affection, and loyalty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His father, Francisco Mercado, and mother were tenants on a vast Dominican-owned estate, giving the family direct experience with the oppressive practices and financial hardships inflicted by the friar orders. This early exposure to social inequality would later influence his writings and reform advocacy.

                    Rizal consistently stressed that proper education should always be prioritized for individual and national success. He achieved academic excellence throughout his schooling, graduating from Ateneo Municipal with a Bachelor of Arts degree and highest honors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Manila, he began using the surname "Rizal" to avoid the suspicion of Spanish authorities. He later earned multiple degrees at the Universidad Central de Madrid, including Licentiates in Medicine and Philosophy and Letters, the latter with an Excellent (Sobrasaliente) rating.

                    The defining political event of Rizal's youth was the martyrdom of the three Filipino priests, Gomburza, in 1872, an event that fueled his early nationalist sentiments. This social and political context, combined with his family's experience in the Calamba Agrarian Unrest, solidified his resolve to use his education to critique the colonial system.
